# Totemstar House Party Fundraiser

Yo! Just seeing this after dinner and a bike ride. I like where it's going! I think since the ticket price is $100 per person, we should make this look really exclusive. Our logo is .:||:. (centered) above TOTEM STAR in Braggadocio font. Can we put that at the top? I think in smaller font under HOUSE PARTY (remove JAM SESH) we could put something like "An Intimate Evening to Amplify Youth Voice." We could say SPECIAL PERFORMANCES BY TOTEM STAR RECORDING ARTISTS. And maybe replace the anchor with a music note? I think we should say 6-9PM / DINNER, DRINKS, AND A SHOW. Something like that? What you think? I'm excited!

Cool!

Can we get replace the gear (above TOTEM STAR) with our logo (.:||:.)? It's a period, colon, two vertical slashes, another colon, and a final period.

Can we change it to "AN INTIMATE EVENING TO SUPPORT YOUNG RECORDING ARTISTS" and keep it all in one font? I like the font you're currently using for "YOUTH VOICE."

Above the address can we add "HOME OF SHAWNA ANGELOU AND JENNA ADORNO" and separate that address text from the rest?

I think "6-9PM / DRINKS, DINNER, AND A SHOW" could be on its own line above "SPECIAL PERFORMANCES..."

We also need to put the "$100 PER GUEST" on the invite. Should we include info on where to buy, or just add a link when we we send the invite via email?

Coming together!
